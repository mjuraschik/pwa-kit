# Store Locator Extension

A PWA Kit extension that adds store locator functionality to your application. This extension provides a store locator solution with features like:

- Search stores by postal code / country code via SCAPI Shopper Stores API
- Device geolocation support
- Configurable search radius
- Multi-country support

## Installation

```sh
npm install @salesforce/extension-store-locator
```

## Peer Dependancies

PWA-Kit Application Extensions are NPM packages at their most simplest form, and as such you can define
what peer dependencies are required when using it. Because this application extension provides
Chakra UI via a page and components, it requires that the some peer dependencies are installed.

Depending on what features your application extensions provides it's recommended you include any third-party
packages as peer dependencies so that your base application doesn't end up having multiple versions of a 
given package. See package.json for the full list of peer dependencies.

The following files in the extension can be overridden in your project:

```

/src/components/store-locator/store-locator-modal.tsx
/src/components/store-locator/store-locator-provider.tsx
